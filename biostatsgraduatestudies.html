You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

    <p>    Biostatistics is the application of  statistics to various areas of biology, especially medicine, but also  agriculture, fisheries and the ecological sciences. Biostatistics research at  the University of Calgary is heavily enmeshed in the field of Health Data  Science, requiring the use of not only high-level statistical methodology, but  also computational and application area expertise.</p>

    <h2><strong>Graduate  Research Training</strong></h2>
    <p>The University of Calgary offers graduate <strong>Biostatistics research training</strong> opportunities  run jointly by the Departments of Mathematics and Statistics (Faculty of  Science) and Community Health Sciences (Cumming School of Medicine). This graduate  training is offered at both the PhD and MSc Thesis levels, available as an <strong>interdisciplinary specialization in Biostatistics</strong> either through the Mathematics and Statistics, or Community Health Sciences,  PhD or MSc-Thesis degrees.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Applied  Collaborative Research</strong></h2>
<p>Students within the interdisciplinary  biostatistics specializations will typically have a statistics/biostatistics  supervisor and a co-supervisor from their research area. Such collaborations  may involve:</p>
<p><strong>Cumming School of  Medicine</strong><br />
  <strong>Faculty of  Veterinary Medicine</strong><br />
  <strong>Department of  Biological Sciences</strong><br />
  <strong>Faculty of  Kinesiology</strong><br />
  <strong>Faculty of Nursing</strong><br />
  <strong>Department of  Computer Science</strong><br />
  <strong>Alberta Health  Services</strong><br />
  <strong>Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute for Child  &amp; Maternal Health</strong><br />
  <strong>Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute</strong><br />
  <strong>Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases</strong><br />
  <strong>Hotchkiss Brain Institute</strong><br />
  <strong>O'Brien Institute for Public Health</strong><br />
  <strong>Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta</strong><br />
  <strong>McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health</strong></p>
<p>The interdisciplinary biostatistics group has strong connections  with the institutes at the Cumming School of Medicine, especially  the&nbsp;O'Brien Institute for Public Health (OIPH). The OIPH was set up to  study ways of improving the health care system and new ways to prevent disease.  Many of the biostatistics faculty are members of OIPH, and are&nbsp;developing  statistical models and tools to further their aims. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Rocky  Mountain Data Science Network</strong></h2>
<p>The University of Calgary, jointly  with our partner the University of British Columbia – Okanogan, was recently  awarded the status of a <strong>Canadian  Statistical Sciences Institute Health Science Collaborating Centre</strong> (CANSSI  – HSCC). Our initiative, entitled the <strong>Rocky  Mountain Data Science Centre</strong> (RMDSC), offers our best Biostatistics  graduate students the chance of paid four or eight month internships, working  in governmental, industrial and academic environments.</p>
<p>Students who participate in this  internship training program will gain hands-on experience in the application of  statistical and computational methods that build on and complement their formal  training. They will learn both the art and science of biostatistics and data  science, and develop important communication, project and time management  skills.</p>
<p>For further details about the RMDSC please  contact Karen Kopciuk: <a href="mailto:kakopciu@ucalgary.ca">kakopciu@ucalgary.ca</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Data  Science and Computational Statistics</strong></h2>
<p>Biostatistics research at the  University of Calgary tends to be focused upon modern, computational, data science  statistical and biostatistical problems. A non-exhaustive list of research  interests of our faculty members includes: </p>
<p>Machine learning <br />
  Data science and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; problems<br />
  Computational statistics and Monte Carlo  methodology<br />
  Clinical trials<br />
  Population health/ecology<br />
  Statistical genetics<br />
  Bioinformatics<br />
  Infectious disease modeling<br />
  Disease surveillance<br />
  Longitudinal data analysis<br />
  Survival analysis<br />
  Multistate models<br />
  Missing data problems<br />
  Bayesian modelling<br />
  Spatial and spatio-temporal statistics<br />
  Functional data analysis<br />
  Causal inference<br />
  Experimental design</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>General Inquiries</strong></h2>
<p><strong>General inquiries</strong> should be addressed to the  Biostatistics Graduate Education Coordinator, Dr. Rob Deardon  (<a href="mailto:robert.deardon@ucalgary.ca">robert.deardon@ucalgary.ca</a>).<!-- end .content --></p>
