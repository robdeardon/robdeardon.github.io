I am a Professor of Biostatistics with a joint position in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Department of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Calgary. 

Much of my recent work has been in the area of infectious disease modelling, but I is also interested in Bayesian & computational statistics, experimental design, disease surveillance methods, spatio-temporal modelling, statistical learning and statistical modelling in general.
