I am a Professor of Biostatistics with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Calgary. Much of my recent work has focused on infectious disease modelling, though my interests also span Bayesian and computational statistics, experimental design, disease surveillance methods, spatio-temporal modelling, statistical learning, and statistical modelling more broadly.

I currently lead a research group of around ten trainees and have published more than 90 papers in peer-reviewed journals. I have served as an Associate Editor for several journals, including Biometrics, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (Series C), and the Canadian Journal of Statistics.

I am also currently serving as President of the Statistical Society of Canada.

#You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.


#To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#{% highlight ruby %}
#def print_hi(name)
#  puts "Hi, #{name}"
#end
#print_hi('Tom')
##=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#{% endhighlight %}
