I am a Professor of Biostatistics with a joint appointment in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Calgary. 

Much of my recent work has focused on infectious disease modelling, especially individual-level models (e.g. spatial) and disease models that incorporate the effect of population behaviour change. 

In addition, my interests also span Bayesian and computational statistics, disease surveillance methods, spatio-temporal modelling, statistical learning, and experimental design. 

I typically lead a research group of ten trainees or more and have published more than 90 papers in peer-reviewed journals. I have served as an Associate Editor for several journals, including Biometrics, the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society (Series C), and the Canadian Journal of Statistics.](https://robdeardon.github.io)

I am also currently serving as President of the Statistical Society of Canada.
